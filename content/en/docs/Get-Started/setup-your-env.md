## 1. Setting Up Flutter

First and foremost, in a Flutter environment you will need to install the Flutter SDK. The installation steps are dependent on your operating system. Follow along the [offical getting started guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) to complete your installation. When you install the Flutter SDK, it will also include the Dart SDK for you.

## 2. Recommended Editors

We recommend using [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows), [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). The offical Flutter guide also includes information to setup each of these options [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor).

IntelliJ is a commonly used IDE. If you have used it in the past, you can continue to use it for your Flutter projects.

Android Studio is an IDE built from IntelliJ specifically for Android development. If you are new to mobile development this a good IDE to start with, it is capable of installing all of your android tooling for you, and makes it easy to create emulators.

Visual Studio Code, when compared to IntelliJ and Android Studio, is the most customizable with a seemingly endless number of programming languages to utilize. Developers commonly call this IDE ‘VS Code’ (who has time to say entire words anyway?). If you have watched our tutorials on atsign.dev, you’ll notice that VS Code is the other IDE of choice with our devs!

Visual Studio Code, VSCode for short, is a customizable text editor. Due to its numerous plugins available, it can be used as an IDE for almost any language. It is the IDE of choice amongst most of our developers, and if you haven't given it a try we recommend that you do!
