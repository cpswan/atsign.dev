The [@platform](/docs/resources/glossary/#@platform) was open-sourced in November of 2020 and we’ve been working hard to make your onboarding experience as smooth as possible ever since.

We’re excited to help you get your very own @platform environment up and running!

### Overview

As a developer on the @platform, there is some additional information you may want to know before getting started. This page will guide you through some of the decisions we've made when building the @platform, and some basic information on how it works.

#### <a href="https://flutter.dev/"><img src="/landing_page/flutter-logo.png" alt="Flutter" height="2%" width="5%"></a>

Why did we choose Flutter? Here are some of our favorite reasons:

• Beautiful User Interface that allows you to control every pixel in your app, bring your brand to life, and provide flawless People experiences.

• Apps directly compile to native ARM code for screaming fast and efficient project builds housing buttery-smooth animations that allow GPU acceleration.

• Hot Reload. Make an edit to your code and Flutter will update your source code files and automatically rebuild the widget tree, allowing you to see your edits almost immediately. No more rebuilding your application time and time again.

• It's free and open-source, just like the rest of the @protocol, and there are countless numbers of packages on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev) that any developer is free to use. The Flutter community is growing fast and would love to welcome you!

#### What is an @sign?

Check out [here](https://atsign.com/what-is-an-sign) for a basic overview.

An @sign in technical terms is a digital identifier. When you pair your @sign with an @platform application, your device will spin up a small [Hive database](https://pub.dev/packages/hive) to store your information. Along with the @sign you get your own private "secondary server" which can be hosted by us, or on your own infrastructure. This secondary server is completely private and controlled by the owner of the @sign, it enables you to backup and synchronize your information across all of your devices. The secondary server is also used to share information to other @signs. For more information on how this works, please read our [whitepaper](https://atsign.com/resources/white-papers/the-platform-white-paper/) which covers the @platform and the underlying @protocol in full detail.
